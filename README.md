This site uses an Oauth login with Instagram and is attempting to upload a file into an AWS S3 bucket...but it's currently sending a 404 'resource not found' when trying to upload the file.  

Adding the relational connections for a user, profile and image model is still under construction. 

There are no relevant tests available since they are based upon a successful upload of a file to the AWS S3 bucket.

Once the bugs are isolated and corrected this will be the start to something great.
